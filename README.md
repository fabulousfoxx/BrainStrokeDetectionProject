# Brain Stroke Detection based on health data

The project I created with [KacperChabros](https://github.com/KacperChabros) for the Data Analysis and Representation course. We were given a dataset containing records of patients, their health data and an information if they had a stroke. We conducted data mining process and clusters analysis. Moreover, we tested various supervised machine learning models to perform classification. Since datasets containing data about health issues are often imbalanced, we checked and used some oversampling strategies.
